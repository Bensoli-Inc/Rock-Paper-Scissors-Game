I used Javascript, html and CSS to create this game. I simply used the math.random function to make the console pick a random number between 0 and 1 and stored it inform of the emoji signs. I therefore created more functions to store player moves and the random console random picks. The if-statement condition would therefore compare playermove and computermove to give results of win/lose/tie. 
Check the full .Js file for the javascript code.
